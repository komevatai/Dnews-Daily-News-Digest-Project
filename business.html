    <p>Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, has been working on a plan to expand its global reach and reach
         out to more people. He has announced plans to open a new warehouse in China and a new store in 
         the United States...
    Andy Jassy was elevated to chief executive of Amazon on Monday, taking the reins from its founder, 
    Jeff Bezos, in one of the most closely watched executive handoffs in years.</p>

   <p>In recent years, Mr. Bezos has stepped back from much of Amazon’s day-to-day business, focusing 
instead on strategic projects and outside ventures, like his space start-up, Blue Origin, giving his 
deputies even more autonomy.

Mr. Bezos, 57, re-engaged on day-to-day matters early in the pandemic. But in February, he announced 
that he planned to step down from running Amazon and would become executive chairman of the company’s 
board. On July 20, he is scheduled to fly aboard the first manned spaceflight of his rocket company.</p>

<p>Mr. Bezos anointed Mr. Jassy, 53, a long-serving deputy who built and ran the cloud computing division, 
to take over as chief executive. Mr. Jassy has worked so closely with Mr. Bezos that he has been viewed 
as a “brain double,” helping conceive and spread many of the company’s mechanisms and internal culture.</p>

                <h3>Tunisia Announces Direct Flights to Nigeria</h3>
                <img src="images/tunisair.jpg" width="400px" height="250px" alt="tunisair">
                <figcaption>Tunisair</figcaption> <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify; word-spacing: 2%;">The Ambassador of Tunisia to Nigeria, Mohsen Antit, has announced that direct flights between <br>
                Tunisia and Nigeria are expected to commence in 2026. This initiative is part of broader efforts to <br>
                 enhance bilateral relations between the two countries. He said this during a press briefing with 
                 journalists on Wednesday in Abuja.</p>

                 <p>He said the introduction of direct flights is crucial for facilitating closer business, political,
                  and cultural interactions, adding that Improved air connectivity is expected to ease travel for 
                  both business people and tourists, thereby strengthening economic and diplomatic relations.
                 
                 Mohsen said, “Flights between Nigeria and Tunisia are primarily operated by non-African Airlines,
                  And out of more than 50 countries in Africa only 3 (Morroco, Ethiopia, Egypt) ensure air links between 
                  their capital and Nigeria”.</p>
                 
                 <p>According to him, the  initiative aims to improve accessibility and foster stronger economic and cultural 
                 ties between the two nations; adding that the plan is still in development, as both countries are committed 
                 to working together to ensure its successful implementation.
                 
                 He said “So we are in North Africa, you are in the West, but the distance is not too far because we are obliged 
                 today to take two flights in order to move to Tunisia. So it’s very contradictory. It’s very contradictory; 
                 
                 So this has to change.</p>
                 
                <p> “And we are working on an airline, of course, between Tunisia and Nigeria in order for our affairs and our
                  relationship to be more effective. So I dealt with the same question with President Tinubu when I met him 
                  in April 2024 about this question; and we convinced one another, that an air flight is compulsory to make the 
                  two peoples nearer to one another. “So it’s scheduled to be effective in 2026, but we should work hard in order to make 
                  sure that Nigeria is part and parcel of this project with Tunisia, Nigeria will not be the only flight of course 
                  to be added to to the web of flights, but we should work together to concretize it.” he said.</p>
